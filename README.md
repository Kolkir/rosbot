# rosbot

With this project I'm learning ROS and want to create differential wheeled robot. It should consists of:

1. Two 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors with ULN2003 Drivers
2. OrangePi board
3. One usb-camera
4. Powerbank

Software for main computation should work on the desktop and I plan to use OrangePi board only for dispatching control commands to motors and for sending camera images. 

## Development plan:

1. Create robot platform - done
2. Create ROS based software for tele-navigation - in progress
3. SLAM
4. Autonomus navigation system
